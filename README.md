###Minimum Viable Project:###
 * ####Phase 1:####
 Have a two page site where on the first page the user chooses a radio button (most receint or most popular), then clicks a button, which links to a second page. The second page uses the youtube api to show the user receint or popular cat videos.

 * ####Phase 2:####
 The user can enter their email and they will be immediately emailed cat video links from youtube. The user will still be able to view cat videos on the second page.

 * ####Phase 3:####
 This phase will have all the functionality of phase 2, but the user will have the option of getting emails of cat videos daily. The email will include cat video links and the option to unsubscribe.

 * ####Phase 4:####
 The videos will be imbeded in the email.

 ###Questions###
 * ####What is the goal of the project?####
 The goal of this project is to get to phase 3.

 * ####Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?####
 I am targeting people who love cat videos!

 * ####What are your personal learning goals?####
 I want to learn about scheduling jobs and automatic emails.

 * ####What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?####
 I expect to be using Rails, JavaScript to format the videos, Sidekiq and Forman to schedule background jobs, and Mailcatcher for testing emails (so they don't actually send).

 * ####What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?####
 I will need to know how to setup a basic rails app, how to call the youtube api, basic JavaScript for styling. I will need to learn how to schedule jobs and how to set up email service.

 * ####What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?####
 I would really like to get to phase 2 within 10hrs.
